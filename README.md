# 🏥 Hospital ER Dashboard  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes **Emergency Room (ER) performance** using **Oracle SQL & Power BI**. It provides insights into **monthly patient trends, waiting times, treatment efficiency, and resource utilization** to improve hospital operations and patient care.  

## 📊 Key Features  
✅ **Monthly trends and patient visit analysis**  
✅ **Average waiting time & treatment duration**  
✅ **Demographics analysis (age, gender, state)**  
✅ **Peak hours for hospital resource allocation**  
✅ **Data-driven recommendations for optimization**  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Oracle SQL** (Data extraction & transformation)  
- **Power BI** (Interactive visualizations & dashboard)  

## 📂 Project Structure  
- **Data/** → Raw & cleaned datasets  
- **PowerBI/** → Power BI dashboard file (.pbix)  
- **Documentation/** → Business requirements, insights, data dictionary  
- **Images/** → Screenshots of the dashboard  

## 🔍 Insights & Recommendations  
📌 **Peak Hours Identified:** Most ER visits occur between **6 PM - 10 PM**, causing long wait times.  
📌 **High Readmission Rate:** 15% of ER patients return within **30 days**.  
📌 **Delays in Treatment:** The average waiting time **exceeds 45 minutes** on peak days.  

### **🚀 Suggested Improvements:**  
1️⃣ **Increase Staff During Peak Hours** to reduce wait times.  
2️⃣ **Implement a Fast-Track System** for non-critical patients.  
3️⃣ **Enhance Triage Efficiency** using AI-based patient severity scoring.
